CONTRIBUTION TO THE HOMEWORK:

- Roy Ricaldi neither is listed among the authors of the homework nor has commits in the git repository. No contribution corresponds to withdrawing from the course.
- Good and regular contributions by other team members but contribution of Arina Kosiakov must not be limited to report writing / mock ups and must concern also actual code writing"
