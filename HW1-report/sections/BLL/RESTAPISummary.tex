\subsection{REST API Summary}

In this first part of the project we implemented the rest related to booking get methods and user get and insert methods in the traditional way, with the information to be inserted in the URI.
We then implemented the other endpoints with parameters to be inserted in the request (this was made also for booking and user).
Part of the URIs are filtered through different filters. M indicates that only users with the role of mamager can access to the endpoint, U indicates that only users (manager and front office members) can access the endpoint.
