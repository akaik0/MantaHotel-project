\subsection{Homepage}
Different sections are created within the homepage to keep all the information easily available. One section is used for displaying information about the hotel itself. Another section summarises the types of rooms a potential customer can choose from, with different images and the last section contains the contact information of the hotel with a given email address and phone number. From this page it is possible to access to the page to login or register, if there is a new costumer.
