\subsection{Log in and registration page}
\par The log in page allows both customers and users (staff members in the reception) to log in and use the Manta Hotel web application, with only their username and password. 
\par If one is not a user, one can register by clicking the registration link. This will send the soon to be user to a registration form where one has to fill out all the necessary information in order to register.
