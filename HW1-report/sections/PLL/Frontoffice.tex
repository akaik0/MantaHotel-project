\subsection{Front office}
The administration interface of a front office user is basically the same as that of the manager, with the difference that some settings are not accessible.
The most different page is the homepage. The front office user sees the same manager homepage, but he cannot see the list of other users with their last accesses and therefore his homepage is only divided into two macro areas. In the first one he can see an overview of the latest news, such as the number of new bookings with some details about that. In the second one a list with the currently bookings and their relative details is shown.
Based on the pages that make up the manager interface, a front office user does not have the permissions to access to the payments page, users management page and every download log button present in all pages.
