\subsection{Other Information}
For the creation of the database 3 custom enumerations have been created: 
roletype, associated to the roles of hotel users (Hotel Manager or Front Office); 
paymentmethod, which contains the possible ways to pay the staying (Visa, MasterCard, Cash ...); 
category, containing a value for each type of room (Single, Double ...).
Customers are supposed to group people that make the bookings or people that stay in the hotel and also people that do both. 
This is the reason why some attributes can be null, for example the email is usually required for a booking but not for a staying and opposite for the document number.
Log is the only entity with which it is not possible to interact since it is automatically filled.
